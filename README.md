# **Abrnoc Interview Task: Shopping Cart Application**

Welcome to the **Abrnoc Interview Task** repository. This project showcases the implementation of a **Shopping Cart** application built with **Vue.js**. The task aims to demonstrate essential frontend development skills such as state management, routing, and component-based architecture.

## **Task Objective**

The objective of this task is to build a fully functional **Shopping Cart** application where users can:
- Add products to the cart
- Update quantities and remove items
- View the total cost of items in the cart
- Simulate a checkout process

## **Key Features Implemented**

- **Product List**: Displays a list of products with their name, price, and "Add to Cart" button.
- **Shopping Cart**: A fully functional cart allowing users to:
  - View items added to the cart
  - Increase or decrease item quantities
  - Remove items
  - Automatically update the total cost of the cart
- **Checkout Simulation**: A simple "Checkout" button to simulate the payment process.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Vue 3**: Modern frontend framework for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **Vuex**: State management for handling cart items and product data.
- **Vue Router**: For seamless navigation between the product list and checkout pages.
- **JSON Server**: Simulating API calls to provide product data.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and improved code maintainability.
- **Prettier & ESLint**: To maintain consistent code style and ensure code quality.

## **Setup Instructions**

To get started with the project, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/abrnoc-interview-task.git
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the mock API server:
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## **Whatâ€™s Next?**

- **UI Enhancements**: Further improvements based on feedback, including UI and UX adjustments.
- **Unit Testing**: Writing tests for components and functionality to ensure the app is robust and stable.
- **Performance Optimization**: Implementing strategies like lazy loading, code splitting, and other performance improvements.

## **Final Thoughts**

This task represents my understanding of frontend development principles, including component design, state management, and performance optimization. I look forward to discussing the project and my approach during the interview.
